This code snippet is designed to generate and display a short romantic poem based on user instructions. Here's a brief synopsis of its functionality:

displayPoem(response): This function takes a response from an API call, extracts the generated poem from the response data, and uses the Typewriter library to animate the display of the poem on a webpage element with the ID "poem". The poem is typed out one character at a time with a delay of 1 millisecond between characters.

generatePoem(event): This function is triggered when a form is submitted. It prevents the default form submission, gathers user input from a text box with the ID "user-instructions", and constructs a prompt for the API that asks for a poem. The context specifies that the poem should be four lines long. An API request is made to a specified endpoint using Axios, and upon receiving a response, the displayPoem function is called to show the poem.

Event Listener: An event listener is attached to the form, which listens for the "submit" event and calls the generatePoem function when triggered.

Overall, the code facilitates the creation of a romantic poem based on user input and displays it in a visually engaging manner.
